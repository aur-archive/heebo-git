<h3>
Match them blocks!
</h3>
<p>
Get three or more blocks of the same colour in a line. Blocks can be swapped by flicking over them. You can only swap blocks when either one of them will line up with three or more in a line. You can also move a block into an empty tile.
</p>

<h3>
Turn all gold!
</h3>
<p>
When three or more blocks of the same colour line up they will explode and turn the background into gold plates! To win a level you must turn all background tiles golden.
</p>

<h3>
Bonus sweetie
</h3>
<p>
If you explode more than three blocks in a line, a bonus background tile with a same colour block on it will be turned into gold. This is handy to get to those last hard-to-reach tiles!
</p>

<h3>
Locked blocks
</h3>
<p>
In the later levels some blocks are locked and can't be moved.  Free them by matching them up with two or more other blocks of the same colour! Some times there are two locks, then you need to match them up twice.
</p>

<p>
Now go flip some blocks!!
